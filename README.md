# Simple Rack Router

ðŸš€ A minimal custom router built from scratch using plain Rack.

This project demonstrates how HTTP routing can be implemented without Rails or Sinatra â€” just using Ruby and the Rack interface.


## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Rack-compatible `call` interface
- âœ… Static routes like `/` and `/about`
- âœ… Dynamic routes like `/users/:id` and `/products/:sku`
- âœ… GET and POST method support
- âœ… Lightweight and readable design


## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

### 1. Install Rack

`gem install rack`

### 2. Run the server

`rackup config.ru`

### 3. Try it out

- [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292)
- [http://localhost:9292/users/123](http://localhost:9292/users/123)
- [http://localhost:9292/about](http://localhost:9292/about)

Visit the above URLs in your browser to see the router in action.


## Purpose

This project exists to showcase how routing works at the lowest level in a Rack-based Ruby web application, without using Rails or Sinatra. Itâ€™s built to be educational, clear, and minimal.
